# Early Unmint

Minted dVOI goes through a 1 week period before it is fully vested, after which it can be withdrawn from the contract and traded freely.

Users who currently have dVOI in a vesting state will be able to "unmint early". This will return their initial VOI payment in exchange for their allocated dVOI.

**Early unminting forfeits any rewards that may have accumulated during the vesting period.**

Most users will opt to wait, claim their dVOI (or have it sent to them automatically) and then [burn it](/burning.html) in order to get rewarded for participating in consensus indirectly.
