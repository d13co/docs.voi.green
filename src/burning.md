# Burning

Burning is the process of returning dVOI tokens to the contract and receiving VOI in return.

Burning, like minting, does not influence the exchange rate of dVOI:VOI - only rewards disbursements and early unminting can do that.

As dVOI has a 1 week vesting period and the consensus rewards are distributed weekly on Voi, users should always be able to exchange their minted and vested dVOI for more VOI than they originally put in to the system.

Users can only burn tokens they hold in their wallet. Unclaimed vested dVOI must be withdrawn first, and then burnt.
